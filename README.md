# Clustering-Algorithm-on-Fashion-MNIST-datset
This project provides the clear understanding of features of unsupervised learning. We can see the performance difference between K-Mean clustering and Gaussian Mixture Matrix Clustering on Fashion MNIST dataset to classify datapoints into 10 clusters. An autoencoder lets us re-represent high dimensional points in a lower-dimensional space called as 'latent space'. We use this reduced dimensional representation for clustering. We can notice the accuracy improving over baseline K-means algorithm when we use Autoencoding and GMM clustering.
